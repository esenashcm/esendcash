The cash advance loan industry is giddy over a recent customer survey that shows that a lot of of their customers could gladly take out the expensive loans again. As a matter of fact, most customers polled in the survey said they were pleased with their loan. This might shock individuals who regard these loans, with interest rates that can exceed four hundred percent a year, as predatory lending. On the other hand, the payday loan business conducted the survey on their own, so perhaps the results are not so astonishing after all.

The payday loan lending industry is in the business of providing temporary loans to people who need a few hundred dollars to pay their bills until they receive their next paycheck. The borrower will get the loan for fourteen days and provides the loan company a postdated check for the amount of the loan plus interest. In fourteen days, the borrower will pay back the loan in cash, or instead, the loan company will deposit the borrower's check. Although the common loan varies from $100-$1500, the interest rates tack on anywhere from $10 to $20 for each $100 borrowed. When thought of as an annual rate of interest, the interest paid on a two week loan can add up to 400% or more each year.
